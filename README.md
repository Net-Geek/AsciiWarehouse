# DiscountAsciiWarehouse
Discount Ascii Warehouse is an Android app that dynamically loads ascii products from an API.

    This project showcases the use of NDJson, Retrofit, Espresso (ATSL), and the Design Support Library.

NDJson
--------
NDJSON is a convenient format for storing or streaming structured data that may be processed one record at a time. It works well with unix-style text processing tools and shell pipelines. It's a great format for log files. It's also a flexible format for passing messages between cooperating processes.

Retrofit
--------
Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc.
Retrofit turns your HTTP API into a Java interface.

Espresso
--------
The Espresso testing framework, provided by the Android Testing Support Library, provides APIs for writing UI tests
to simulate user interactions within a single target app. A key benefit of using Espresso is that it provides automatic
synchronization of test actions with the UI of the app you are testing. Espresso detects when the main thread is idle,
so it is able to run your test commands at the appropriate time, improving the reliability of your tests.
This capability also relieves you from having to adding any timing workarounds, such as a sleep period, in your test code.

Design Support Library
--------
The Design Support Library brings a number of important material design components from Android 5.0+ to all developers and to all Android 2.1 or higher devices.
