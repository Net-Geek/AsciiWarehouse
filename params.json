It works well with unix-style text processing tools and shell pipelines. It's a great format for log files. It's also a flexible format for passing messages between cooperating processes.\r\n\r\nRetrofit\r\n--------\r\nRetrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc.\r\nRetrofit turns an HTTP API into a Java interface. Methods declared on an interface represent a single remote API endpoint and annotations describe how the method maps to an HTTP request. Retrofit also allows developers to easily covert this response body data into a POJO.\r\n\r\nEspresso (ATSL)\r\n--------\r\nThe Espresso testing framework, provided by the Android Testing Support Library, provides APIs for writing UI tests\r\nto simulate user interactions within a single target app. A key benefit of using Espresso is that it provides automatic\r\nsynchronization of test actions with the UI of the app being tested. Espresso detects when the main thread is idle,\r\nso it is able to run test commands at the appropriate time, improving the reliability of the instrumentation tests.\r\nThis capability also relieves a developer from having to adding any timing workarounds, such as a sleep period, in their test code.\r\n\r\nAndroid Data Binding Library\r\n--------\r\nThe Android Data Binding Library allows developers to write declarative layouts and minimize the glue code necessary to bind application logic and layouts. This library allows us to eliminate a ton of boilerplate code such as findByViewId() calls, adding references to views (inside activities/fragments), setting listeners, etc. This library also allows us to declare custom attributes on the fly (and associate it with static methods), instead of declaring it in attrs.xml. It supports ternary, null coalescing operators, call object methods and integration with collection frameworks.\r\n\r\nAndroid Design Support Library\r\n--------\r\nThe Android Design Support Library brings a number of important material design components from Android 5.0+ to all developers and to all Android 2.1 or higher devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
